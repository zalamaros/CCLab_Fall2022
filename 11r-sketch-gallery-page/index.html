    <p>In Mini Project 5 we were instructed to make our own imaginary creatures, and utilize objects. I made an owl
      + cat
      fusion creature. I've had this imaginary creature in my mind since I was younger, and would even doodle versions
      of
      it, which can be found in my old sketchbooks. It was really fun and interesting to be able to recreate it in a
      college class.

      Here is a link to a funny website I thought I would include.
